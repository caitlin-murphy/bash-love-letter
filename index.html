				<h1>Love letter to Bash</h1>
			</header>
			<section>
				<p class="box">
				Bash, my dear love, what I have discovered in you, <br>
				is the answer to my prayers, the greatest tool I can choose. <br>
				Not long ago I was a naive girl, <br>
				going through my days without a care in the world. <br>
				Constantly on my laptop as a millennial is, <br>	
				I only used my mouse to click the buttons. <br>
				Little did I know there was program prepared, <br>
				to let the users control anything that they dared. <br>
				Hidden in <em>applications</em>, buried in <em>utilities</em>, <br>
				was the program terminal that would ease all my worries.<br>
				</p>
				<p class="box">
				You opened my eyes to a world once unkown, <br>
				you greet me with my username making me feel right at home. <br>
				But ah that reminds me, where am I? By pressing <em>pwd</em> you reveal to me <br>
				Right in my directory, right where I should be. <br>
				When I need to move on I just type <em>cd</em><br>
				Followed by the <em>directory name</em> I’m wanting to see.<br>
				But if I need to take a step back, I know you’ll still care, <br>
				I just press <em>cd ..</em> and you will take me there<br>
				By typing <em>cd /</em> you take me to the root of it all, <br>
				Where I can see all my directories and access it all. <br>
				</p>
				<p class="box">
				Bash you have been such a gift in my life, <br>
				You have given me purpose, left me without strife<br>
				I have never been so structured, but still so free<br>
				I can create files with just a command, <em>mkdir</em>(ectory)<br>
				Files are easy too, I just type <em>touch</em> and the name. <br>
				You have made loving you so easy, my life will never be the same. <br>
				You can show me all that my directories contain,<br>
				I can just type <em>ls</em> and the files are there to obtain. <br>
				I know I can always trust that you will be honest with me, <br>
				Through the command <em>ls -la</em> your hidden files are there to see. <br>
				</p>
				<p class="box">
				Even though we may disagree and have made small mistakes, <br>
				We work through it together and remove all our haste. <br>
				Through the command <em>rm</em> I can delete the unwanted information, <br>
				I just add <em>-f</em> (for files) or <em>-r</em> (for folders) and the train leaves the station. <br>
				</p>
				<p class="box">
				Even when I get lost or confused, you keep me centered. <br>
				I can communicate with you using only a few letters. <br>
				You can show me software versions through the command <em>-v</em> <br>
				And you allow me to read a files text so easily, <br>
				I just type the command <em>cat</em> and it is shown on the machine, <br>
				and to escape the reader I press <em>control + c</em> and I’m back to the main screen.<br>
				</p>
				<p class="box">
				We can even finish each other’s sentences, it’s pretty darn cute<br>
				Once I start the name of a file I press <em>tab</em> and you finish with resolute <br>
				And through typing the <em>up arrow</em> you even mimic the line above, <br>
				Making my heart bursting with love. <br>
				</p>
				<p class="box">
				When I need to start over you completely understand, <br>
				I just press <em>command K</em> and the magic is in your hands. <br>
				You clear the screen for me and we start again, <br>
				But our love remains, and will until the end.
