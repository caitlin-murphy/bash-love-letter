	Bash, my dear love, what I have discovered in you, 
	is the answer to my prayers, the greatest tool I can choose. 
	Not long ago I was a naive girl, 
	going through my days without a care in the world. 
	Constantly on my laptop as a millenial is, 
	I only used my mouse to click the buttons. 
	Little did I know there was program prepared, 
	to let the users control aything that they dared. 
	Hidden in applications, buried in utilities, 
	was the program terminal that would ease all my worries.

	You opened my eyes to a world once unkown, 
	you greet me with my username making me feel right at home. 
	But ah that reminds me, where am I? By pressing pwd you reveal to me 
	Right in my directory, right where I should be 
	Even when I get misguided, you calm my 
	I know I can press cd / to get to the root 

	While you are beautiful in every shape and size I can custom create you
	Through preferences I can change your style to be calm and blue or hot pink and wild.
